                    <h2>What Are World Heritage Sites?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A World Heritage Site is a landmark or area with legal
                        protection by an international convention administered by the
                        United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
                        (UNESCO). World Heritage Sites are designated by UNESCO for
                        having cultural, historical, scientific or other form of
                        significance. The sites are judged to contain "cultural and
                        natural heritage around the world considered to be of
                        outstanding value to humanity." To be selected, a World
                        Heritage Site must be a somehow unique landmark which is
                        geographically and historically identifiable and has special
                        cultural or physical significance. For example, World Heritage
                        Sites might be ancient ruins or historical structures,
                        buildings, cities, deserts, forests, islands, lakes,
                        monuments, mountains, or wilderness areas. A World
                        Heritage Site may signify a remarkable accomplishment of
                        humanity, and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on
                        the planet, or it might be a place of great natural beauty.
                        As of June 2020, a total of 1,121 World Heritage Sites (869
                        cultural, 213 natural, and 39 mixed properties) exist across 167
                        countries; the three countries with most sites are China, Italy
                        (both 55) and Spain (48).

                        The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity,
                        which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal
                        trespassing, unmonitored, uncontrolled or unrestricted access,
                        or threat from local administrative negligence. Sites are
                        demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones. The list is
                        maintained by the international World Heritage Program
                        administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, composed of
                        21 "states parties" that are elected by their General
                        Assembly. The programme catalogues, names, and conserves
                        sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the
                        common culture and heritage of humanity. The programme began
                        with the "Convention Concerning the Protection of the World's
                        Cultural and Natural Heritage",[ which was adopted by the
                        General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972. Since then,
                        193 states parties have ratified the convention, making it one
                        of the most widely recognised international agreements and the
                        world's most popular cultural programme.
